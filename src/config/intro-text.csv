report/Supplemental Test Results/APL' vs Power Charts,"This chart helps us understand the relationship between APL', pre-gamma Average Picture Level as defined in IEC 62087, and TV power level, primarily for the purpose of understanding the effectiveness of APL' as a metric used in test clip development. This data also shows the extent to which the tested TV scales power to picture level. "

report/Supplemental Test Results/Light Directionality,This test is performed primarily to understand how much luminance drops-off towards the edge of the display due to pixel-level light directionality. The data examined has been corrected for image distortion (e.g. fish-eye effect) and vignetting.
